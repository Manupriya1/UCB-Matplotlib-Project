## PyBer - ride sharing analysis with Python using Jupyter Notebook -Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of the school:
I used Pandas and Matplotlib libraries on Jupyter notebook to analyze ride sharing data for PyBer. I used prescarpped datasets. 
##### First data set called city data and has three columns:
- city,
- driver_count
- type
The type column has three catagoies: rural, suburban and urban

##### The second data set called ride data and has four colums:
- city, 
- date, 
- fare, 
- ride_id

Our goal is to compare total weekly fares for each city type and make recommendations to address any disparities. 

## Results:
I analysed the data to understand the differnece in the following parameters with different city type:
1. Total Rides : As we can see in the table below that urban cities has the most ride and rural cities has the least.

2.  Total Drivers: As we can see in the table below that urban cities has far more number of divers as compared to rural cities.

3. Total Fares: Urban cities make the most fare, then suburbans and rural cities make the least fare.

4. Average Fare per Ride: Urban cities has the least average fare per ride and rural cities have the most fare per ride.

5. Average Fare per Driver:  The drivers from the rural areas earns te most fare and drivers from the urban area earns the leaset.
