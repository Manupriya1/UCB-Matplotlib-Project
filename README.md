## PyBer - ride sharing analysis with Python using Jupyter Notebook -Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of the school

I used Pandas and Matplotlib libraries on Jupyter notebook to analyze ride sharing data for PyBer. I used prescarpped datasets. 
-First data set called city data and has three columns:
  -- city, 
  -- driver_count, 
  -- type
The type column has three catagoies: rural, suburban and urban

-The second data set called ride data and has four colums:
  -- city, 
  -- date, 
  -- fare, 
  -- ride_id

Our goal is to compare total weekly fares for each city type and make recommendations to address any disparities.
