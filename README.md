## PyBer - ride sharing analysis with Python using Jupyter Notebook -Pandas and Matplotlib

## Overview of the school:
I used Pandas and Matplotlib libraries on Jupyter notebook to analyze ride sharing data for PyBer. I used prescarpped datasets. 
##### First data set called city data and has three columns:
- city,
- driver_count
- type
The type column has three catagoies: rural, suburban and urban

##### The second data set called ride data and has four colums:
- city, 
- date, 
- fare, 
- ride_id

Our goal is to compare total weekly fares for each city type and make recommendations to address any disparities. 

## Results:
I analysed the data to understand the differnece in the following parameters with different city type:
1. Total Rides : As we can see in the table below that urban cities has the most ride and rural cities has the least.

2.  Total Drivers: As we can see in the table below that urban cities has far more number of divers as compared to rural cities.

3. Total Fares: Urban cities make the most fare, then suburbans and rural cities make the least fare.

4. Average Fare per Ride: Urban cities has the least average fare per ride and rural cities have the most fare per ride.

5. Average Fare per Driver:  The drivers from the rural areas earns te most fare and drivers from the urban area earns the leaset.

  ## Summary: 
  Based on the results below, here are the three business recommendations for addressing the disparities among the city types:

  1. Increasing the number of drivers in the rural cities:  As we can see the number of rides and total fare is very low for rural cities. This could be because of the high        average fare per ride in the rural area, So I recommend bringing the fare down in the rural cities to make the rides more affordable. This could be done by increasing      the number of drivers that will increase the competiton and will bring the fare down. 
  3. Increasing the fare per driver in the urban cities : As we can see the drivers in the urban cities are earning very little as compared to the rural and suburban cities        so by limiting the number of drivers in the urban cities the company can help drivers make more money per ride and improve job retention and satisfaction. 
  4. As urban cities have higher total fares, PyBer must think about expanding more to Urban and suburban cities as compared to rural cities.
